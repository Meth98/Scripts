				<p>Linux</p>
				It is a family of free and open-source software operating systems built
				around the Linux kernel. Typically, Linux is packaged in a form known as
				a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both desktop and server
				use. The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel,
				an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by
				Linus Torvalds. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their
				name. The Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to refer to
				the operating system family, as well as specific distributions, to
				emphasize that most Linux distributions are not just the Linux kernel,
				and that they have in common not only the kernel, but also numerous
				utilities and libraries, a large proportion of which are from the GNU
				project. This has led to some controversy.

					<span> Shell</span>: A shell script is a computer program designed to
					be run by the Unix shell, a command-line interpreter. The various
					dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages.
					Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file
					manipulation, program execution, and printing text. A script which
					sets up the environment, runs the program, and does any necessary
					cleanup or logging, is called a wrapper.
				</div>

				<div class="three-col">
					<span> Perl</span>: It is a family of two high-level, general-purpose,
					interpreted, dynamic programming languages, Perl 5 and Perl 6. Though
					Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms in
					use, including "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language". Perl was
					originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix
					scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it
					has undergone many changes and revisions.
				</div>

				<div class="three-col">
					<span> Python</span>: It is an interpreted, high-level,
					general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and
					first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes
					code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides
					constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large
					scales. In July 2018, Van Rossum stepped down as the leader in the
					language community.
